<h2>About the Task Force</h2>
            <p>
                The UMB Centers & Institutes Task Force is tasked with surveying the current stable of Centers and
                Institutes withing the university.
            </p>

            <p>The main charge of the task force is to:

                <ul>
                    <li><b>Classification of Centers and Institutes (C&I):</b> discussion of what the types of C&I
                        might be like here, what are some of the elements or characteristics of these, how are they
                        organized and what types of financial structures would be used to support them.</li>

                    <li><b>Funding options:</b> what are some of the possible funding options for C&I, what are some of
                        the incentives that should be considered in seeking alternative funding, what are the
                        activities that may lead to alternative as well as core university support for C&I, what
                        university resources could be available (university advancement, ORSP, other)</li>

                    <li><b>Evaluation guidelines for C&I:</b> what should periodic evaluation strategies for C&I be,
                        including but not limited to criteria, frequency and fiscal resources as well as mission
                        relevance and contributions to the University</li>
                </ul>
            </p>
            <p>These parallel the directives in the survey which are:

                <ul>
                    <li> A definitional document that classifies centers and institutes, differentiating among types of
                        mission (e.g., teaching centers, research centers, outreach/service centers, fee-based
                        centers);
                    <li> Recommended guidelines for funding options for centers and institutes, differentiated by
                        mission-type; these guidelines should address such questions as:
                        <ul>
                            <li> To what extent should each mission-type be expected to achieve fiscal self-sufficiency
                                through external funds, versus to what extent certain activities of a center or
                                institute should be supported by internal funds or in-kind contributions;
                            <li> Where a center or institute's mission crosses boundaries among types, the principles
                                on which its costs should be apportioned among different sources of funds (e.g.,
                                external funds, development funds, the general operating budget of the university);
                        </ul>
                    <li> A campus process for periodically evaluating centers and institutes for the efficacy with
                        which they meet their missions, for the value and relevance of their programmatic efforts, and
                        for their efficient and appropriate use of funds, in compliance with the
                        (yet-to-be-established) guidelines â€“ to include a process by which centers or institutes may be
                        sunsetted if they fail to maintain programmatic and/or fiscal viability.
                </ul>
