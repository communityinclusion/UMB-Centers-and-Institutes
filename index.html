<h2>About the Task Force</h2>

<p>The UMB Taskforce on Centers & Institutes is charged to study the missions and funding options for the Centers and Institutes on campus, with the goal of drafting and recommending to the Provost a definitional document that will guide the classification of centers and institutes, discuss funding options depending on the mission and type of the center or institute and provide guidelines for evaluation of such centers and institutes. </p>
<p>The main charge of the task force is: 
<ul>
    <li><b>Classification of Centers and Institutes (C&I):</b> discussion of what the types of C&I might be like here, what are some of the elements or characteristics of these, how are they organized and what types of financial structures would be used to support them.</li>
<li><b>Funding options:</b> what are some of the possible funding options for C&I, what are some of the incentives that should be considered in seeking alternative funding, what are the activities that may lead to alternative as well as core university support for C&I, what university resources could be available (university advancement, ORSP, other)</li>
<li><b>Evaluation guidelines for C&I:</b> what should evaluation strategies for C&I be, including but not limited to criteria, frequency and fiscal resources as well as mission relevance and contributions to the University</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>The Taskforce has established three sub-committees addressing the core areas of its charge.  The three sub-committees are defined as follows: </p>
<p><b>Classification of Centers and Institutes:</b> Definition; The Classification sub-committee will <i>discuss the categories of Centers and Institutes based on the aspects of campus mission they support (e.g. student success, research, community engagement, synergistic); key definitional elements and characteristics of each; how are they organized including appropriate reportage and responsibility (department, Dean or Provost); the types of financial structures that would be used to support them over time and expectations.</i></p>

<p><b>Funding Options Sub-Committee: Definition;</b> The Funding Options Sub-Committee <i>will generate information and ideas about how to diversify, stabilize and increase long-term funding for C&I with reference to their missions. We approach these goals by collecting information from a list of peer institutions, our own experiences and through information provided by university and community stakeholders. Our work is guided by the following questions: 1) what are the activities that may lead to obtaining external funding sources to complement university support for C&I? 2) what university resources are available to assist C&Iâ€™s with growing external funding? 3) what are the incentives that should be considered for persons seeking alternative funding? and 4) what are some of the possible funding options for C&I based on mission?</i></p>

<p><b>Evaluation guidelines Sub-Committee: Definition;</b>The Evaluation Guidelines Sub-Committee will consider <i>a range of critical decisions regarding matters such as creation and dissolution, university funding and support, performance, etc., the sub-committee will focus on the following: (1) what criteria should be considered in evaluating institutes and centers, e.g., mission and purpose, constituencies, productivity, funding sources, student and faculty engagement, ability to leverage resources, personnel, impact and reputation, community engagement, historical factors, etc., (2) what data and evidence should be utilized in evaluating centers and institutes, (3) what processes should be instituted for evaluating centers and institutes (among the reviews where processes for evaluations may be developed are annual reviews, budget reviews,  AQUAD like reviews, etc.) and (4) who should be involved in evaluating centers and institutes?</i></p>
<p>
 These definitions will parallel the areas of solicitation in the survey below.
